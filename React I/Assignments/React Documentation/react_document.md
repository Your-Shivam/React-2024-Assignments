# Question & Answer

  1. What is React?
- React is a library in Javascript. Libraries in Javascript are some code that store in a cloud server it's called `CDN` and **CDN** is basically stands for `Content Delivery Network`.

  2. Who made React?
- React was developed by a team of engineers at Facebook. The primary developer credited with creating React is Jordan Walke.

  3. What is Babel?
- Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write code using the latest ECMAScript standards (or even future standards) and then converts it into an older version of JavaScript that can be executed in environments that may not support the latest features.

4. How does Babel convert HTML code in React into valid code?
- Babel is not specifically designed for converting HTML to React code. Babel is primarily used for transpiling JavaScript code. React code, which includes JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React), is transpiled by Babel to regular JavaScript that browsers can understand.

5. What is ReactDOM used for? Write an example?

- ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM-specific methods for working with React. It is used for rendering React components into the DOM. Here's a simple example:

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

```
- In this example, the ReactDOM.render function is used to render the App component into the HTML element with the ID 'root'.

6. What are the packages that you need to import for React to work with?
   
- To work with React, you typically need to import react and react-dom. If you're using JSX, you may also need Babel to transpile the code. Here's a basic example:
- 
  ```
  import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const App = () => {
  return `<h1>`Hello, React!`</h1>`;
};

ReactDOM.render(`<App />`, document.getElementById('root'));

``` 

7.  How do you add React to a web application?
To add React to a web application, you need to include the React and ReactDOM libraries in your project. You can do this by adding script tags in your HTML file or by using a module bundler like Webpack. Additionally, you may need Babel if you're using JSX. Once the libraries are included, you can start creating React components and use ReactDOM.render to render them into the DOM.


8. What is React.createElement?
- React.createElement is a method used to create React elements. It is commonly used when writing React components without JSX. It takes three arguments: the type of the element (string for HTML elements or a reference to a React component), optional properties (or "props") of the element, and the element's children.


9. what are the three properties that createElement accepts?

- The React.createElement method accepts three arguments:

     - Type: The type of the React element, either a string representing an HTML element or a reference to a React component.
    - Props (optional): An object representing the properties of the element. These are the attributes you would set on an HTML element.
    - Children (optional): The content of the element, which can include other React elements or simple text strings.


10. What is the meaning of render and root?

- Render: In the context of React, "render" refers to the process of converting React components into actual HTML elements and displaying them on the screen. The ReactDOM.render function is commonly used for this purpose.

Root: In React, the "root" typically refers to the root DOM node where your React application will be attached. When using ReactDOM.render, you specify the root element as the second argument. For example: ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root')); This means the React application will be rendered inside the HTML element with the ID 'root'.
